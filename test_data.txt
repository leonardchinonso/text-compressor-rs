The Lost Key

Alice was in a hurry. She had to catch the bus to the airport, where she was going to meet her boyfriend, who had been away for six months. She grabbed her suitcase, checked her passport, and ran out of the door. She locked it behind her and put the key in her pocket.

She reached the bus stop just in time. The bus was already there, waiting for the last passengers. She showed her ticket to the driver and boarded the bus. She found a seat near the window and put her suitcase on the rack above her. She took out her phone and texted her boyfriend: “On my way, can’t wait to see you!”

She smiled as she received his reply: “Me too, love you!” She put her phone back in her pocket and looked out of the window. The bus started moving and soon left the city behind. Alice felt a surge of excitement and happiness. She was going to see him again, after so long.

She closed her eyes and imagined his face, his smile, his hug. She remembered their last day together, when they had said goodbye at the airport. He had kissed her and told her he would be back soon. He had given her a necklace with a heart-shaped pendant, which she wore every day. He had also given her a key, which he said was the key to his heart.

She opened her eyes and reached for her necklace. She felt the pendant with her fingers and smiled. Then she felt for the key in her pocket. But it was not there.

She panicked. She searched all her pockets, but she could not find it. She looked around, hoping to see it on the floor or on the seat. But it was nowhere to be seen.

She realized she must have dropped it when she locked the door of her apartment. She cursed herself for being so careless. How could she lose something so important? How could she face him without it?

She felt a wave of sadness and guilt wash over her. She wanted to cry, but she held back her tears. She decided to call him and tell him what happened. Maybe he would understand and forgive her.

She took out her phone and dialed his number. But before she could press the call button, she heard a voice behind her.

“Excuse me, miss, is this yours?”

She turned around and saw a man holding a key in his hand. He had a friendly smile on his face.

She gasped. It was the key.

She recognized it immediately. It had a heart-shaped head and his initials engraved on it.

She could not believe it. How did he find it? How did he know it was hers?

She took the key from him and thanked him profusely.

He said he had seen it on the ground near the door of her apartment building. He had picked it up and followed her to the bus stop. He had boarded the same bus as her and waited for a chance to return it to her.

He said he knew it was hers because he had seen her necklace with the matching pendant.

He said he was glad he could help.

He said he hoped she had a nice trip.

He said goodbye and returned to his seat.

Alice was speechless. She could not thank him enough. He had saved her from a lot of trouble and embarrassment.

She looked at the key in her hand and felt a surge of relief and gratitude.

She put it back in her pocket and made sure it was secure.

She took out her phone and texted her boyfriend: “I have a surprise for you!”

She smiled as she received his reply: “Can’t wait!”

She looked out of the window and saw the sun shining brightly.

She felt a surge of excitement and happiness.

She was going to see him again, after so long.

And she had the key to his heart.
